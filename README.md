This is a SwiftUI development project for iphone.

It is an APP displaying the latest musicals in the New York City.

In the first tab, you can slide the banners, view musicals starting from different years, view the details, 
and select to-watch (yellow star) or favorite (red heart) as marks which will show in the second list tab 
including two filter buttons. From the first tab, there is my profile on the top right.
